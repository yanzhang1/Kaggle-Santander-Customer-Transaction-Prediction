# Kaggle-Santander-Customer-Transaction-Prediction

Here is my python scripts for the kaggle's predictive analysis project.

1.'EDA.py' file is used to explore and check our dataset.

2.'MODEL.py' file gives one way to fit training dataset and predict target values based on test dataset. It also includes the feature importance check.

3.'OTHERS.py' aims at testing some hypothesis. Like trying to use undersampling method to handle with our imbalanced data and using several different classifier then take the majority votes. Or to create some new features and test their performance by the measurement of accuracy.  

I've tried some ways, including the methods in 'OTHERS.py', but all failed. Anyway, I'll keep updating.
